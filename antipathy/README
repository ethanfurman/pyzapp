Antipathy -- for those tired of ``os.path``
===========================================

Tired of calling a function for every path manipulation you need to do?

Is::

    >>> path, filename = os.path.split(some_name)
    >>> basename, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    >>> basename = basename + '_01'
    >>> new_name = os.path.join(path, basename+ext)

wearing on your nerves?

In short, are you filled with antipathy [1] for os.path?

Then get antipathy and work with Path::

    >>> from antipathy import Path
    >>> some_name = Path('/home/ethan/source/my_file.txt')
    >>> backups = Path('/home/ethan/backup/')
    >>> print some_name.path
    '/home/ethan/source/'
    >>> print some_name.ext
    '.txt'
    >>> print some_name.exists()
    True  # (well, if it happens to exist at this moment ;)
    >>> backup = backups / some_name.filename + '_01' + some_name.ext
    >>> print backup
    '/home/ethan/backup/my_file_01.txt'
    >>> some_name.copy(backup)

Because Path is a subclass of bytes/str/unicode, it can still be passed to other functions that expect a bytes/str/unicode object and work seamlessly [2].

[2] in most cases -- there are a few places that do a `type` check instead of an `isinstance` check.
